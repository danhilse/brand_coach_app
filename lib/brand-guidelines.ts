## **Voice**

Our brand voice is: Refreshingly Direct

Our voice transcends the written word and informs how we behave, our personality and style.

### **01. Natural, conversational and straightforward**

Our frank, conversational tone sets us apart as a brand that talks straight. We speak plainly, like we're the coolest person at the party with nothing to prove. It's not arrogance, but confidence, authenticity.

We don't try too hard with our headlines, jokes, references, puns and don't use corporate-speak, jargon, or 'overly-smart' language.

Examples of words to avoid: seamless, synergy, enable, align, actionable

### **02. Authentic & Approachable**

The tone we use reflects confidence and ease; we know who we are and what we offer; we don't have to try too hard, because we are authentically ourselves.

We use humor where appropriate, particularly to make dry topics more engaging, but we always stay professional when discussing serious topics that impact our audience's jobs and businesses.

### **03. Gender-Neutral and Inclusive**

We don't use any language that denigrates people based on their gender, background, or any other identity. Everyone is a part of our community, and we strive to be inclusive, for example, by using gender-neutral pronouns and removing racially-coded language.

Examples of exclusionary terms to avoid: blacklist, stand up, guys, master, kill, sexualized language

### **04. Tailored to Channel and Content Type**

Our new brand voice will come out more in some channels and content types than others. If we are overly "challenging" on all of our content, it may come across as aggressive and unwelcoming. See next page for more details.

## **Tone of Voice Spectrum**

Our voice underpins everything we say in the market. But our tone will vary from channel to channel depending on what our audiences need from us. Even at our most challenging, we support marketers as best we can. On the left, at our most supportive, we're challenging marketers to be bold and do more.
